"Those coding bearded jerks are all same, but this one thinks he is a bloody genius, though all he does is just tapping his greasy keyboard with his fat greasy fingers for a few lines of crappy code.",1,1

Why the hack we hired this retard.,1,1
"With this WFH attitude, they are all just freaking out, it's just impossible to call them to god damn order.",1,1
He is god damn slow in everything he does.,1,1

This chick is damn good.,1,1
"All I can say is that Andrew is managing his team tremendously well, though he is not always tolerant, often being tough, but those gooks deserve it",1,1

Bill is really on the best sales guys in the company ever. Last year this son of a gun brought as many new clients and the rest of the sales team altogether!,1,1
